Lanelet maps [#laneletpaper]_ have been introduced in the context of the autonomous
completion of the Bertha-Benz-Memorial-Route in 2013 [#presse]_.

The lanelet concept includes a map specification as well as an editing
tool chain. The lanelet maps are built on top of

* ``libLanelet`` (provided here)
* the OpenStreetMap (OSM) file format [#osmformat]_
* JOSM, the Java OSM editor [#josm]_
* The RAILS port, which provides the OSM server [#rails]_
* ``osmosis`` to retrieve bigger portions of the map from the database [#osmosis]_

All components are open source and users profit from lanelet maps immediately.

``libLanelet``
==============

``libLanelet`` is a library which

* parses OSM XML files
* builds the lanelet map
* provides access to the attributes of lanelets and regulatory elements
* allows routing through the graph
* is released under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 3 or later [#gpl]_.

Quickstart
==========

* `Download libLanelet <lanelets_iv_2014.tar.gz>`_
* Follow the install instructions given in the ``README`` file (especially about the depedencies) and `this video <http://youtu.be/K2GKEDoe7ck>`_:
* Make a map and parse it with libLanelet (there is `a video <http://youtu.be/284xfabEUZ4>`_ as well)  
* Use ``libLanelet`` in your software. A good point to start is ``demo.cpp`` as well as the test cases in ``lanelet_tests.cpp``.
    
Configuring JOSM
================

Additionally, the archive contains
a JOSM style file as well as the corresponding icons. To activate the style,

* press ``F12`` to get into the configuration dialog
* in the third tab (titled *settings for the map projection*), go to *Map Paint Styles* and press the ``+`` to add the style sheet. In the area below, append the icon directory to the list.

  for right bounds.

Common pitfalls
===============

The thing with the OSM-IDs
  JOSM does not know about global IDs. So when you create new elements, they will have a negative ID which indicates that the element is not known
  to the OSM server. As soon as this element is uploaded, the server will assign a globally unique ID which is stable at least
  during the element's life. Until then, JOSM displays 0 as ID unless you hange `osm-primitives.showid.new-primitives` to `true` in ``Preferences`` / ``[x] Expert mode`` / ``Advanced Preferences``.

The thing with the node identity
  Points (or better *nodes*) are considered identical if they have the same ID. It is not sufficient to place two different points near each other. Usually
  this causes trouble with lanelet adjacency.
